"104","jive records production: artist rating: what do you do for an encore after making one of the most ground-breaking unique and outstanding hip-hop albums ever? instead of moving ahead to an uncharted musical plateau that may be over everyone’s head, the tribe have veered off to the side, molding their jazz-infused samples with fat hardcore beats to give their progressive sound a streetwise edge the most prevalent theme on this record is the tribe’s disillusionment with the music industry. song topics address shady promoters, bootleggers and the greedy, insensitive record labels that rip-off artists. meanwhile tip and ali drop some more fat loops from their secret sample vaults. the tracks are kept simple and feature the type of fat drum beats that can be heard from a boomin’ system three blocks away. instead of just throwing a beat over a loop, the tribe combine distinct pieces of music, program their own beats, and transform their samples into a sound that is truly their own. they add the right touch--whether its a live bass with singing on q- tip’s “ verse from abstract,” or the jazzy sax loop on phife’s” butter.” q- tip has already proven he is a highly skilled lyricist with his own distinct style and once again he flows lovely, dubbing himself “the abstract poet.” those who questioned phife’s microphone techniques on the first album will swallow those doubts as he practically steals the show on this one. phife provides a more straight-up b-boy approach to complement tip’s mellow vibes other outstanding cuts include “ buggin’ out”, an uptempo jam with a catchy bassline, “ rap promoter” with its chunky guitar samples, “ show biz”, featuring brand nubian’s lord jammar and sadat x and ex- ultimate force member diamond d, and “ scenario” a duet with the leaders of the new school that feature some incredible lyrics from busta bhymes. there’s no sophomore jinx to be found here--only real hip-hop","record report albums a tribe called quest - the low end theory"

"141","as hip- hop grows older, it is interesting to see which artists are able to maintain musical longevity. in this age, many acts fight so hard to retain their musical integrity and originality that they sometimes suffer from self-indulgence. these artists get so wrapped up in themselves that they ultimately lose their listeners. the ongoing musical struggle is to maintain the balance between unique artistry and universal fatness.       a tribe called quest represents a group of young musicians who know how to give the people what they want. tribe has always been at the forefront of the musical progression in hip- hop with their unique use of jazz samples and live instrumentation. we all must remember that tip and ali were two of the key producers responsible for that whole ""rim shot, high hat, kick drum"" flavor ( tom scott) that every producer in hip- hop has imitated to the point of making it redundant.       tribe's consistency has to do with their ability to find the perfect verbal cadence in their lyrical delivery and freely mix that up with their sophisticated musical arrangements. as a result, their range and scope has proven to be very broad, with the group producing everyone from run- d m c to nas to tiger to tony toni tone. tribe also exemplify the essence of being contemporary electronic musicians by transferring the same determination and work ethic that gave them the skills to use s p sampling machines to teaching themselves how to play the bass guitar, keyboards and the trap drum set.       tribe's seriousness and focus is very refreshing, and these qualities easily explain their growth and success. it's clear to me why a tribe called quest stays on top of their game and continue to be at the head of their class. [ rap pages:] tell me how you like to work. [ q- t i p:] we like to develop the beats at home and then lay the tracks in the studio. [ r p:] what type of setup do you have at the crib [ q- t i p:] s p, mackie four-track, two technics turntables, g l i mixer, a yamaha speaker that's about watts with an eight-inch woofer built in the amp. it's just a little small setup for my room in my crib. i also have an akai four-track and i like it because of the e qs set. they have the indentures in it and it's easy to maneuver. i have an atari computer, and ali likes working with the mac. the mac is compatible and i work with both. the language on the atari is a little easier. [ r p:] so when you go to the studio, do you bring your own equipment or do you rent? [ q- t i p:] sometimes we rent and sometimes we bring our own shit. it depends on if you have the proper casing so the equipment won't get messed up. i'd rather bring it, cause you save money. [ a l i s h a h e e d:] i have an ensonic keyboard, korg keyboard, a couple of korg modules [, ]. sampler, a regular mackie c i, a laptop computer for the road, a mackie mixer, a roland mixer, a yamaha monitor. [ r p:] what's your equipment setup like, phife? [ p h i f e:] a pen and a pad. [ a l i s h a h e e d:] oh, yeah, my bass. [ r p:] how long have you been playing? [ a l i s h a h e e d:] about eight months. [ q- t i p:] he's pretty good on the keyboards too. [ r p:] are you self-taught musicians? [ a l i s h a h e e d:] everything we are doing is self-taught. we learn by sitting in the studio just playing, going back 'n' forth. we play drums too. [ q- t i p:] doing music is the best part to me out of all this shit. [ r p:] one of the things i've always thought about is if y'all played instruments. were y'all ever in a band in school? [ a l i s h a h e e d:] i was in a band and i played clarinet and saxophone. i played for four years. i couldn't afford a sax, so when school was over i had to turn in my clarinet and sax. that's what really stopped me. i played up until junior high. [ r p:] when did you start producing? [ q- t i p:] when we were . back then we had a tascam four-track, a truband sampler--yo, we used to freak that shit. we got a lot of sampling time out of that. two technics and a mixer. [ a l i s h a h e e d:] eventually, we started to get more and more stuff. [ q- t i p:] eventually, i want my own studio. my dream board is the sony g m l. ali likes the s s ls, but i can't mess with them. s s ls are cool because they are process. i like mixing on them, but i'd rather cut on a neve board. on a neve, you have more bottom out. it's a warmer sound and it's chunky. then with an s s l, you can come clean everything up. so i like to mess it up first, then clean it up with the s s l. [ r p:] when you mix, do you use analog or digital? [ a l i s h a h e e d:] when we are mixing we use analog and digital just to have both. at the end of the process, whichever sounds better, that's what we use. we don't record in digital, we record everything in analog. [ r p:] when i interviewed large professor, he told me about your crew-- premier, diamond, pete rock, showbiz--and how you all go shopping for beats. [ q- t i p:] we are on a never-ending quest for records. not just to make beats, but just to know about music. i learn from listening to other people's music. [ r p:] i heard that a lot people was at that record show at the roosevelt hotel in new york city. what was that all about? [ q- t i p:] everybody right now is on this whole beat stupor. i've been getting beats since high school. me, my man ju ju from the beatnuts. afrika [ jungle brothers]. it's nice that everyone is getting involved, because it's enough for everyone. but now niggas is buying records for the beat and just that loop. again, i like to listen to the records as well. niggas be on some secret squirrel shit: "" oh, i can't tell you what record it is."" it's all here for the taking. it's still fun for me, because it's my job and hobby. [ r p:] have y'all started a production company yet? [ q- t i p:] yes, we have a production deal with east west records called museum music. we have one artist, vinia moheta.","traveling theorizing and marauding with a tribe called quest"
